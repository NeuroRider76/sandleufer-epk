    <p>
      Sandleufer is more than a DJ—he’s a storyteller behind the decks. Born Bilal Baertschi, Sandleufer’s journey runs deep: from early inspiration in 60s/70s classics and the energy of German and French hip-hop, to a sound that today effortlessly transcends genres.<br><br>
      A life-altering hand injury in his twenties could have ended his creative path, but instead became fuel for his evolution. DJing became both therapy and obsession—a way to channel resilience into rhythm.<br><br>
      From the first sets in underground studios to hypnotic mainstage performances at international clubs like Club Freud in Frankfurt (opening for Lilly Palmer), Sandleufer connects generations. He’s released on labels including Armada, Mauerwerk Techno, Cea Music, and Blanc Audio—occasionally under his psytrance-focused alias <b>Bewan</b> (notably for releases on Armada).<br><br>
      His dream? To one day play Kappa FuturFestival in Italy, with his mother pressing play before he takes the stage.<br><br>
      For Sandleufer, DJing isn’t just about BPMs or genres. It’s about dissolving boundaries and giving every person in the room a moment of true freedom—where the outside world disappears, and the crowd moves as one.
